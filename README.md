This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# future works
Map view should have search bar and results filter function
alternative list view should be available for those that don't prefer map view
there should be a view all shops feature with options to filter by cuisine, location, keywords, etc (similar to property guru)
http://localhost:3000/my-business - there should be a cancel changes button

# bugs
A dropdown list of Google Maps suggestions does not appear. walk me through how to debug this
clicking on website in map pin leads to http://localhost:3000/kocinadepinay.com instead of kocinadepinay.com
