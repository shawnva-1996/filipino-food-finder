This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

when users pay, they should pay to filipino food finder first, filipino food finder earns its cut, then business owner is paid


# bugs
instead of http://localhost:3000/store/riDvIe6ymmT5tQLKByZC, it should be http://localhost:3000/store/Good-Bites (the last part should be the store name, not the store ID)

when doing this: Submit with 5 stars, comment "Great food", and Upload an Image, Image was not visible 

[ ] Rate Restaurant (General): Click "Write a Review" (top of reviews section). Button did not work

# prompt
use tailwind v4 (no tailwind.config.ts file)

<!-- use nextjs 15.1.x (then use tailwind 3) -->

when emitting codes, emit the full code so I can easily copy and paste    

to ensure no features are lost between every iteration, only emit the code file by file, emitting the full, corrected code with ALL features each time
